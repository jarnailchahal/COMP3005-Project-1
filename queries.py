queries.py (Carleton University COMP3005 - Database Management Student Template Code)

This is the template code for the COMP3005 Database Project 1, and must be accomplished on an Ubuntu Linux environment.
Your task is to ONLY write your SQL queries within the prompted space within each Q_# method (where # is the question number).

You may modify code in terms of testing purposes (commenting out a Qn method), however, any alterations to the code, such as modifying the time, 
will be flagged for suspicion of cheating - and thus will be reviewed by the staff and, if need be, the Dean.

The following is the connection information for this project. These settings are used to connect this file to the autograder.
You must NOT change these settings - by default, db_host, db_port and db_username are as follows when first installing and utilizing psql.
For the user "postgres", you must MANUALLY set the password to 1234.

The following 10 methods, (Q_n(), where 1 < n < 10) will be where you are tasked to input your queries.
To reiterate, any modification outside of the query line will be flagged, and then marked as potential cheating.
